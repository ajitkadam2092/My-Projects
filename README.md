**Problem Statement : **

This is a project on Amazon PPC campaign for the 5 different products.
Each of the campaigns in the sheet is targeting one search term.

The report covers the date range 11th October - 9th December 2019. If a campaign doesn’t have a row for a certain day it’s because they received zero impressions on that day.

The report doesn’t show the amount bid for each campaign. 

You can assume the profit margin for the product in the campaigns is 40%.

The cost per click will always be the same, or lower than the bid.

You’re in charge of making bid adjustments for each campaign based on the report given.

What bid would you suggest each campaign is set to make sure every campaign has maximum profitability?

Please also include details of your thought process and detail any other suggestions for best managing the PPC campaigns.


**Calculation**
Please check the excel sheet for the detail calulation of product wise overall 'Click Through Rate', 'Cost Per Click' and Overall Marketing spends versus total sales.

**Insight / Recomendation ** : 

**1) Search Term One** -  Overall CTR of the campaign is really good. The number of impressions are not very much . So there is a possibility that we may not be using proper keywords to reach out to wider audience. The campaign has potential to reach maximum number of people. If  budget allows us to increase our spending on advertisement without hampering profit much,  we can do Keyword research for the campaign. Choosing right keywords for the campaign and targeting wider audience  can increase the sales.

2) **Search Term Two** -   The campaign has generated comparitevely high number of impressions, yet their number of clicks are very low thus resulting into poor click through rate. We can improve the quality of our content ,add Call to Action button to improve our Conversion rate. We can bid less CPC for the campaign because it does not the have problem reaching out to the wider audience , this way we can also improve our profit margin.
3) **Search Term Three** - This Product has very low Click Through Rate even though number of impressions are high. There is possibility that we may be targetting wrong audience also the quality of the content may be poor. The overall spending on the advertisement is 59% of the total sales. We can conclude that the strategy of advertisement for the product is very poor.
4) **Search Term Four** - The campaign has very high click through rate, however it has failed to reach wider audience since the number of impressions are very less. The percentage of spends on the advertisement to the overall sales is also very less, so there is scope to increase our budget on the campaign. We can do keyword research and optimization, write an more engaging ad to reach out to more number of people.
5) **Search Term Five** -  The current camapign is having decent number of impressions but somehow it has very less number of clicks , thus resulting into poor Click-Thru rate. The Overall net spend on the advertisement  over the given timespan of the campaign is 32.13 $ and yet it still fails to generate any sales. Due to very poor CTR we can conclude that the given stategy of advertisement for the product is very poor and hence can not gaurantee profit even if we increase spending on advertisement. Taking into view the higher number of impressions , I would suggest that the quality of the advertisement should be enhanced using precise content and adding a call to action button and targeting right audience.
