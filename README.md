**Problem Statement : **

This is a project on Amazon PPC campaign for the 5 different products.
Each of the campaigns in the sheet is targeting one search term.

The report covers the date range 11th October - 9th December 2019. If a campaign doesn’t have a row for a certain day it’s because they received zero impressions on that day.

The report doesn’t show the amount bid for each campaign. 

You can assume the profit margin for the product in the campaigns is 40%.

The cost per click will always be the same, or lower than the bid.

You’re in charge of making bid adjustments for each campaign based on the report given.

What bid would you suggest each campaign is set to make sure every campaign has maximum profitability?

Please also include details of your thought process and detail any other suggestions for best managing the PPC campaigns.
